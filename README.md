# Desktop Air Monitoring Light Alarm Device
## About
This device is a prototype for detecting desktop air temperature and PM values. The LED strip can be used in different colors to warn of low humidity or high PM values.
When these values exceed or fall below a threshold, the OLED displays the current value detected by the sensors. 
If you want to view the data detected by the sensor but the humidity and PM values are safe on the desktop, you can press on the touch sensor to activate the OLED display.
